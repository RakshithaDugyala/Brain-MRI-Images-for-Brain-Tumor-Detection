# Brain-MRI-Images-for-Brain-Tumor-Detection
This code presents a deep learning-based approach for classifying brain tumors using MRI image data. The analysis begins with importing essential libraries such as numpy and pandas for data handling, and sets up the file path for the dataset. The dataset, organized into two folders—yes for tumor images and no for non-tumor images—is loaded by iterating through the directory structure and constructing a DataFrame containing image file paths and their corresponding labels. Initial data exploration steps include displaying the first few rows of the dataset, examining its shape and column structure, and checking for duplicate or missing values to ensure data quality.

Following data preparation, the notebook likely continues with preprocessing steps such as image resizing, normalization, and label encoding to prepare the data for input into a deep learning model. Although not all cells are previewed yet, typical workflows in such notebooks involve splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, constructing a convolutional neural network (CNN) using frameworks like TensorFlow or Keras, and training the model to classify MRI scans based on whether a tumor is present. The model's performance is usually evaluated using accuracy metrics and confusion matrices to assess its diagnostic capabilities. The structured approach from dataset loading to model training suggests that this notebook serves as a robust pipeline for automated medical image classification, potentially assisting in early diagnosis of brain tumors.
